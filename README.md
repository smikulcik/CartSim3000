Shopping Spree
---

Zoom your buggy as fast as you can through the store aisles.  
Collect as many items in your cart before the time runs out.
Shopping Spree! is a shopping cart simulator where the
objective of the game is to fill up your cart with items
before the time runs out.  Use your arms to put items into
your cart, or crash your cart into the shelves to knock items
into your cart.  Collect enough items and you will get on
the high score board!

Shopping Spree! is all about creativity and having fun.
This fast-paced game is not intended to be realistic as
one should not be crashing shopping carts into store aisles.
Rather, this game provides an environment for each player to
explore their repressed desire to run as fast as he can and
jump on the back of a moving shopping cart.
